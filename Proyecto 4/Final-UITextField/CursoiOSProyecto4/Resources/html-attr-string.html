<p><b>Pokémon</b> (Japanese: <b>ポケットモンスター</b> <i>Pocket Monsters</i>; <b>ポケモン</b> <i>Pokémon</i> for short) are fictional creatures that are central to the <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> franchise. There are currently <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number" title="List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number">898 known species</a> that inhabit the <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_world" title="Pokémon world">Pokémon world</a>; however, it is implied that there are more waiting to be discovered. Inherent to them are several fantastic powers not demonstrated by most real animals, such as the manipulation of <a href="/wiki/Electric_(type)" title="Electric (type)">electricity</a> or <a href="/wiki/Fire_(type)" title="Fire (type)">fire</a>. Pokémon are shown to exist instead of animals in their world, although animals are also seldom seen in older media.
</p><p>While most Pokémon resemble animals and may behave like them, there are many that do not resemble animals at all, taking on other forms such as plants, inanimate objects, machines, human-like forms, or other more enigmatic and exotic appearances. Pokémon inhabit an extremely diverse range of habitats, ranging from the driest <a href="/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">deserts</a> to the lushest jungles, the deepest oceans to the highest <a href="/wiki/Category:Mountains" title="Category:Mountains">mountains</a> and everything else in-between, even <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_Pok%C3%A9mon" title="Extraterrestrial Pokémon">outer space</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Dimensions" title="Dimensions">dimensions</a>. Pokémon take up various ways of living in those places. However, all can be befriended and made into potential allies.
</p><p>Many Pokémon are able to <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolve</a> from or into other Pokémon, a process that typically makes them larger and stronger, and more closely resembles growth and development or metamorphosis rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution" class="extiw" title="wp:evolution">evolution in the real world</a>. Pokémon typically know several <a href="/wiki/Move" title="Move">techniques</a> that they can use in <a href="/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_battle" title="Pokémon battle">battle</a> or elsewhere, either to defend themselves or their Trainer, or to perform a task. In the anime, most Pokémon are known only to say their name. In the games, each Pokémon has a <a href="/wiki/Cry" title="Cry">distinct voice associated with each species</a>.
